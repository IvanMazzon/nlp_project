## Requirements

Pipenv is used to create a virtual environment and install all other required dependencies automatically.

```bash
pip install pipenv
```

Next, run the following commands in the project directory.

```bash
export PIPENV_VENV_IN_PROJECT=1
pipenv install
pipenv shell
```

Finally, execute the Jupyter Notebook file using the Python kernel in `.venv/bin/python`.
